## Setting

Most theoretical results are for iid data 

All the `lm(...)` / `glm(...)` stuff you learned is for iid

Another common name for this type of data is "cross-sectional"

Lots of data is not this

--

<hr>

1. **Longitudinal (panel) data:** measure $M$ units repeatedly at $T$ times

2. **Clustered data:** measure $M$ units at each of $J$ locations

3. **Time series:** measure 1 unit at $T$ times

--

These slides are **not** about time series.

## Examples


.pull-left-narrow[

1. Quiz scores

2. HIV data

3. TSR Shifts?

4. Sugary beverages?
]

.pull-right-wide[
```{r bc-covid, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

## Clustered or Longitudinal data

* Just correlated within the unit

> Within each unit, the observations are correlated.


* Correlated over time

> Within each location, past values are related to future values.


* Random effects

> Each unit / location needs it's own mean parameters.

## Notes so far

1. Lots of parameters 

2. Impacts coefficient estimates, model specification

3. Impacts inference (CIs on the coefficients)

--

 ---
 
Need assumptions to make this work (usually)

**Simple example:** (random effects model)

* Observe $M$ students in $J$ classrooms. Each student takes a standardized test.

* $y_{ij}$ is the score of the ith student in the jth classroom.

* Typical (random effects) model is:
$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \gamma_j + \epsilon_{ij},\quad \epsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\sigma^2),\quad \gamma_j \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\tau^2)$$

--

**Compare to:**

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \x_{ij}^\top\vbeta + \epsilon_{ij},\quad \epsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\sigma^2)$$

where $\x_{ij}$ is a 0-1 dummy vector indicating membership in class $j$

---
## Watch out

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \gamma_j + \epsilon_{ij},\quad \epsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\sigma^2),\quad \gamma_j \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\tau^2)$$

On average, the $\gamma_j$'s are zero. But their estimates won't necessarily sum to 0 exactly.

However, they are interpreted as deviations from $\beta_0$, the overall average score.

$\textrm{Var}(y_{ij}) = \sigma^2 + \tau^2$ for all $i,j$.

We have also modeled correlation within each classroom.

--

* $\textrm{Cov}(y_{ij},\ y_{i'j}) = \tau^2 >0$

--

**Compare to**
$$y_{ij} = \x_{ij}^\top\vbeta + \epsilon_{ij},\quad \epsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\sigma^2),$$
where $\x_{ij}^\top = \mathbf{1}(\textrm{person i is in class j})$.

* ~Won't change the estimated variance of $y_{ij}$.~ Think about what $y_{ij}$ is.
* But no model for the covariance within schools
* Interpretation of the coefficients is different (could address with a contrast)

---

## Likelihood

$$L(\beta_0,\ \vgam,\ \sigma^2,\ \tau^2 ;\ \mathbf{y}) = p(\mathbf{y}\ |\ \vgam)p(\vgam) = \prod_{i=1}^M\prod_{j=1}^J \frac{1}{\sigma\tau}\varphi\left(\frac{y_{ij}-(\beta_0 +\vgam_j)}{\sigma}\right)\varphi\left(\frac{\vgam_j}{\tau}\right).$$

MLEs are easy to calculate for everything, here.

Not easy in general.

--

$$\ell(\theta; \vy) \propto \frac{1}{2MJ}\lVert \vy -\beta_0 -  \mathbf{X}\vgam\rVert_2^2 + \frac{\sigma^2}{2\tau^2}\lVert \vgam \rVert_2^2$$

Easy to get a point estimate with ridge regression (have to choose $\lambda = \sigma^2/\tau^2$)

---

## Bayesian version

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \gamma_j + \epsilon_{ij},\quad \epsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\sigma^2),\quad \gamma_j \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0,\tau^2)$$

Need priors on $\beta_0$ (fixed effect?), $\sigma^2$, $\tau^2$.

Can do uninformative, everything is nice and conjugate.

Looks "like" the ridge version.

---

## Back to full generality

$$y_{ij} = \x_{ij}^\top \vbeta + \z_{ij}^\top \vgam_j  + \epsilon_{ij}, \quad \epsilon_{ij} \overset{iid}{\sim} \N(0, \sigma^2),\quad \vgam_j \overset{iid}{\sim}\N(0,\mathbf{R})$$

The $\vbeta$ is the "fixed" effect.

The $\vgam$ is the "random" effect.

Both together are a "mixed model".

Easily estimated in `R` with `lme4::lmer(...)`.

This will give you p-values with frequentist coverage.

--
 
 ---

This is intellectually challenging for me.

I'm a pragmatic frequentist. 

I've decided $\vgam_j$ is random, so why not just do the Bayesian thing now?

* You don't get a p-value.... (turns out you don't from `{lme4}` either)

---
## Worked example

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(lme4)
str(sleepstudy)
```

* On day 0 the subjects had their normal amount of sleep. 
* Starting that night they were restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night. 
* `Reaction`, represents average reaction times in milliseconds (ms) on a series of tests given each `Day` to each `Subject`

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height=3}
sleepstudy %>%
  ggplot(aes(Days, Reaction, color = Subject)) +
  facet_wrap(~Subject, labeller = label_both, nrow=2) +
  theme_bw(16) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,3,6,9)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="lm") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

---

## Two models

Random intercept, fixed slope.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
f1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ (1 | Subject) + Days, sleepstudy)
```

Random intercept, random slope.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
f2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
```

Comparisons

```{r, echo = TRUE}
anova(f1, f2)
```

---

## Inference

* `{lme4}` does not produce p-values [see the vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf)

* `{lme4}` also does not produce CI's or p-values for the random effects.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
confint(f2)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ranef(f2) # display the point estimates for the random effects
```

I find this annoying. 

The reasoning is something like "CI's are asymptotic, but the asymptotics don't really hold for any finite sample size, so these things aren't trustworthy"

---

## An alternative

1. Be a Bayesian. .secondary[Many clients won't want this.]

2. [`{merTools}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/merTools/vignettes/merToolsIntro.html).

```{r, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
library(merTools)
rs <- REsim(f2, n.sims = 200) # parametric bootstrap
fs <- FEsim(f2, n.sims = 200)
```

.pull-left[
```{r fe-plot, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3}
merTools::plotFEsim(fs)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r re-plot, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
merTools::plotREsim(rs)
```
]

---

## Ugly

I think those plots are ugly. I'll fix the random one.

1. Look at the function. Type `View(plotREsim)` at the console
2. Find the guts and see what I need to fix.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
grabber <- function(x) x[1]
p <- rs %>% 
  mutate(
    sd = sd * qnorm(1 - (1-.95)/2),
    ymin = median + sd,
    ymax = median - sd,
    pid = fct_reorder(as.factor(groupID), median, grabber)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pid)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin=ymin, ymax=ymax)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = median, color = pid), size = 3) +
  facet_wrap(~term, ncol=1, scales = "free_y") +
  theme_bw(18) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)) +
  ylab("Random effects")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r re-plot-better, fig.height=5}
p
```
]

# Missingness

---

## Typical (na√Øve) approach

The .secondary[complete case] approach: use only the complete cases, ignore the rest.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mean(z, na.rm = TRUE)
lm(y~., data=dat, na.action = na.omit)
```

The issue isn't really .secondary[existence of missing cases].

The issue is .tertiary[why] are the missing cases missing?

--

* Student skips homework because she got a headache. (Headaches are random, not correlated with homework skill)

* Student skips homework because she read the first question and it was hard.

---

## Missing data mechanisms

**Missing completely at random** (MCAR) -- the missingness depends neither on the missing values nor on the observed values


**Missing at random** (MAR) -- the missingness does not depend on the missing values but may depend on observed values

**Missing not at random** (MNAR) -- the missingness may depend on the missing values and the observed values (also called "non-ignorable missingness")

--

 ---

1. Student had a headache and skipped the assignment.

2. Student did poorly on homework 1 and skipped homework 2.

3. Student thought homework looked hard, didn't do it.

---
## Na√Øve approaches

**Complete case method:** Throw out the missing observations.

* Works if MCAR, otherwise biased. 

* Technically inefficient compared with the hypothetical that the data was complete.

**Mean imputation:** impute missing data with average of observed

**Last-value carried forward:** impute later missing values with the previous observed value

* The second is common in longitudinal / time series.

* Both result in incorrect confidence intervals.

* You treat the "filled" data as real, so sample size is larger.

* You ignore the uncertainty in the imputation

---

## Multiple imputation

.emphasis[
Impute values for each missing entry with the predicted values based on other observed data under an assumed imputation model.
]

Repeat the imputation multiple times.

Example procedure (given a matrix of data):

1. Treat column 1 as a response and the others as predictors.
2. Initialize missing values in predictors to something.
3. Fit a linear model of y on the rest. 
4. Predict missing values in y given complete rest.
5. Impute missing y with prediction + noise from prediction interval.

Loop over columns.

--

 ---
 
End up with multiple completed data sets. 

Analyze each individually with the same model.

Combine the results in a particular way.

Correctly incorporates uncertainty from missingness into CIs for final model.

`{mice}` package does basically this. See the [documentation](https://amices.org/mice/)

### Others

**Be a Bayesian.**

* Not much different from `{mice}`. 

* Looks like "missing data are parameters. model them. do MCMC over all parameters"

**EM algorithm.**

* Integrates over the missingness.

* Need to derive the algorithm specifically for your problem.

* Sort of like infinitely many imputations.

**Weighting.**

* Estimating equations, observed data get larger weight.

Censoring, dropouts, measurement error are not the same as missingness.
