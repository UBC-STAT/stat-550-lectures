McDonald\n-   daniel@stat.ubc.ca \n-   <http://dajmcdon.github.io>\n-   Associate Professor, Department of Statistics \n:::\n:::{.column width=\"50%\"}\n* Moved to UBC in mid-March 2020, 2 days before the border closed\n* Previously a Stats Prof at Indiana University for 8 years\n:::\n::::\n\n. . .\n\n![](https://weareiu.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/map-1.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n## No More Canvas!!\n\nSee the website: \n\n<https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-550/>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\nYou'll find\n\n* announcements\n* schedule\n* lecture slides / notes\n\n(Grades still on Canvas)\n\n\n\n## Course communication\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n### Website:\n\n<https://ubc-stat.github.io/stat-550>\n\n* Hosted on GitHub.\n\n* Links to slides and all materials\n\n* Syllabus is there. Be sure to read it. (same idea as before)\n\n\n### Slack:\n\n* This is our discussion board.\n\n* Note that this data is hosted on servers outside of Canada. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy.\n\n* We'll use a Channel in the UBC-Stat Workspace\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n### Github organization\n\n* Linked from the website.\n\n* This is where you complete/submit assignments/projects/in-class-work\n\n* This is also hosted on US servers <https://github.com/Stat550-2022>\n:::\n::::\n\n## Why these?\n\n1. Yes, some data is hosted on servers in the US.\n1. But in the real world, no one uses Canvas/Piazza, so why not learn things they do use?\n1. Canvas is dumb and hard to organize.\n1. GitHub is free and actually useful.\n1. Much easier to communicate, \"grade\" or comment on your work\n1. Much more DS friendly\n1. Note that MDS uses both of these, the department uses both, etc.\n1. More on all this later.\n\n. . .\n\nSlack help from MDS --- [features](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/slack/) and [rules](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/slack_asking_for_help/)\n\n\n## What are the goals of Stat 550?\n\n<br>\n\n### 1. Prepare you to do the consulting practicum (Stat 551)\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n### 2. You're a captive audience, so I can teach you some skills you'll need for \n    \n* MSc Thesis/Project or PhD research\n* Employment in Data Science / Statistics.\n* These are often things that will help with the first as well\n\n## 1. Prepare you for the consulting practicum (Stat 551)\n\n* understand how the data was collected\n\n* implications of the collection process for analysis\n\n* organize data for analysis\n\n* determine appropriate methods for analysis that [answer's the client's questions]{.secondary}\n\n* interpret the results\n\n* present and communicate the results\n\n::: {.notes}\n* In most courses you get nice clean data. Getting to \"nice clean data\" is non-trivial\n* In most courses things are \"IID\", negligible missingness\n* Usually, the question is formed in statistical langauge, here, you are responsible for \"translating\"\n* Interpretation has to be \"translated back\"\n* Presentation skills --- important everywhere\n:::\n\n## 2. Some skills you'll need\n\n* Version control\n* Reproducible reports\n* Writing experience: genre is important\n* Presentation skills\n* Better coding practice\n* Documentation\n\n## Computing\n\n* All work done in R/RMarkdown. \n* No you can't use Python. Or Stata or SPSS.\n* No you can't use Jupyter Notebooks.\n* All materials on Github. \n* You will learn to use Git/GitHub/RStudio/Rmarkdown.\n* Slack for discussion/communication\n\n## Getting setup\n\n1. Add to Slack Channel: <https://ubc-stat.slack.com/archives/C04QUDNJG9X>\n2. Github account: <https://github.com/> \n3. Add to the Github Org --- tell me your account\n4. RStudio synchronization\n\n\n",
