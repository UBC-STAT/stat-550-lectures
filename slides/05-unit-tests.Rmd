It is easy to write lots of code.

But are we sure it's doing the right things?

**Effective testing tries to help.**

---

## A Common (Interactive) Workflow

1. Write a function.
1. Try some reasonable values at the REPL to check that it works.
1. If there are problems, maybe insert some print statements, and modify the function.
1. Repeat until things seem fine.

(REPL == Read-Eval-Print-Loop, the console, or Jupyter NB)

This tends to result in lots of bugs.

Later on, you forget which values you tried, whether they failed, how you fixed them.

So you make a change and maybe or maybe not try some again.

---

## Example:

```{r norms}
two_norm <- function(x) sum(x^2)
grouped_two_norm <- function(x, gr) as.vector(tapply(x, gr, two_norm))
gr_two_norm <- function(x, gr) sum(grouped_two_norm(x, gr))
```

* There's a silly bug in the above code. 

* At one point, I decided that I didn't want the $\ell_2$-norm, I wanted the **squared** $\ell_2$ norm.

* But now the other two functions are wrong.

--

These functions get used in many other places.

To make sure I don't do something dumb ever again, I write **unit tests**.

---

## Unit Testing

* A **unit** is a small bit of code (function, class, module, group of classes)

* A **test** calls the unit with a set of inputs, and checks if we get the expected output.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
test_that("group norms are correct", {
  asparse <- .05
  gr <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,3)
  x <- -5:5
  expect_equal(two_norm(c(-5 , 5)), sqrt(50)) # this one will fail
  expect_equal(
    grouped_two_norm(x, gr),
    c(two_norm(x[1:4]), two_norm(x[5:6]), two_norm(x[7:11])))
})
```

Unit testing consists of writing tests that are

* focused on a small, low-level piece of code (a unit)
* typically written by the programmer with standard tools
* fast to run (so can be run often, i.e. before every commit).


---

## Unit testing benefits

Among others:
* Exposing problems early
* Making it easy to change (refactor) code without forgetting pieces or breaking things
* Simplifying integration of components
* Providing natural documentation of what the code should do
* Driving the design of new code.

## Components of a Unit Testing Framework

.pull-left[

* Collection of **Assertions** executed in sequence. 
* Executed in a self-contained environment.
* Any assertion fails `r fontawesome::fa("long-arrow-alt-right", orange)` Test fails.

Each test focuses on a single component.

Named so that you know what it's doing.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
## See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
test_that("Conway's rules are correct", {
    # conway_rules(num_neighbors, alive?)
    expect_true(conway_rules(3, FALSE))
    expect_false(conway_rules(4, FALSE))
    expect_true(conway_rules(2, TRUE))
    ...
})
```

## A test suite

.pull-left[
* Collection of related tests in a common context.

* Prepares the environment, cleans up after

* (loads some data, connects to database, necessary library,...)

* Test suites are run and the results reported, particularly failures, in a easy to parse and economical style. 

* For example, Python’s `{unittest}` can report like this

## What do I test?

**Core Principle:** Tests should be passed by a correct function, but not by an incorrect function.

The tests must apply pressure to know if things break.
* several specific inputs for which you know the correct answer
* "edge" cases, like a list of size zero or a matrix instead of a vector
* special cases that the function must handle, but which you might forget about months from now
* error cases that should throw an error instead of returning an invalid answer
* previous bugs you’ve fixed, so those bugs never return.


Make sure that incorrect functions won't pass (or at least, won't pass them all).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
add <- function(a, b) return(4)
add <- function(a, b) return(a * b)

test_that("Addition is commutative", {
  expect_equal(add(1, 3), add(3, 1)) # both pass this !!
  expect_equal(add(2, 5), add(5, 2)) # neither passes this
})
```

## Test-driven development

Test Driven Development (TDD) uses a short development cycle for each new feature or component:

1. Write tests that specify the component’s desired behavior.   
    The tests will initially fail because the component does not yet exist.

1. Create the minimal implementation that passes the test.

1. Refactor the code to meet design standards, running the tests with each change to ensure correctness.

**Why work this way?**

* Writing the tests may help you realize  
    a. what arguments the function must take,   
    b. what other data it needs,   
    c. and what kinds of errors it needs to handle. 

* The tests define a specific plan for what the function must do.

* You will catch bugs at the beginning instead of at the end (or never).

* Testing is part of design, instead of a lame afterthought you dread doing.

---
## Rules of thumb

1. **Keep tests in separate files** from the code they test. This makes it easy to run them separately.

1. **Give tests names.** Testing frameworks usually let you give the test functions names or descriptions. `test_1` doesn’t help you at all, but `test_tree_insert` makes it easy for you to remember what the test is for.

1. **Make tests replicable.** If a test involves random data, what do you do when the test fails? You need some way to know what random values it used so you can figure out why the test fails.

1. **Use tests instead of the REPL.** If you’re building a complicated function, write the tests in advance and use them to help you while you write the function. If you debug your code by calling the function on the REPL with various arguments, you’ll waste a lot of time compared to writing those calls into a test and running it every time you make changes.

1. **Avoid testing against another's code/package.** You don't know the ins and outs of what they do. If they change the code, your tests will fail.

1. **Test Units, not main functions.** You should write small functions that do one thing. Test those. Don't write one huge 1000-line function and try to test that.

.emphasis[
* `R`, use `{testthat}`. See the [Testing](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) chapter from Hadley Wickham’s R Packages book.
* `python` use `{pytest}`. A bit more user-friendly: [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

## Practice

**Gradient ascent.**

* Suppose we want to find $\max_x f(x)$.

* We repeat the update $x \leftarrow x + \gamma f'(x)$ until convergence, for some $\gamma > 0$.

**Poisson likelihood.**

* Recall the likelihood.
$$L(\lambda; y_1,\ldots,y_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\lambda^{y_i} \exp(-\lambda)}{y_i!}$$

**Goal:** find the MLE for $\lambda$ using gradient ascent

**Deliverables:**
1. A function that computes the gradient of the log likelihood.
1. A function that *does* the operation.
1. A collection of tests that make sure your functions work.
