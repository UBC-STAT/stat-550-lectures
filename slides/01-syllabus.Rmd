## No Canvas!!

## See the website: <https://stat550-2021.github.io/>

You'll find
* announcements
* schedule
* lecture slides / notes
* descriptions of deliverables

---

## Course communication

**Website:**

<https://stat550-2021.github.io/>

* Hosted on Github.

* Links to slides and all materials

* syllabus is there. Be sure to read it.


**Slack:**

* This is our discussion board.

* Note that this data is hosted on servers outside of Canada. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy.


**Github organization**

* Linked from the website.

* This is where you complete/submit assignments/projects/in-class-work

* This is also hosted on US servers <https://github.com/stat550-2021/>

---

## Why these?

* Yes, some data is hosted on servers in the US.

* But in the real world, no one uses Canvas/Piazza, so why not learn things they do use?

* Canvas is dumb and hard to organize.

* Github is free and actually useful.



* Much easier to communicate, "grade" or comment on your work

* Much more DS friendly

* Note that MDS uses both of these, the department uses both, etc.

* More on all this later.

???
* No company has used it ever.
* It costs UBC lots of money
* Yes it keeps a calendar for you, but you're a grad student. Keep your own calendar like an adult.
* Github is part of the course objectives.

---

## Synchronous time (for now)


* I'm not going to record/post lectures, generally

* This is a small graduate class. I won't force it, but I prefer you keep your videos on.

* Try to "Raise a blue hand" and ask questions out loud rather than in the chat

## What are the goals of Stat 550?

---

## Two major intersecting themes

#### 1. Prepare you to do the consulting practicum (Stat 551)


<br><br>

#### 2. You're a captive audience, so I can teach you some skills you'll need for 
    
1. MSc Thesis/Project or PhD research
1. Employment in Data Science / Statistics
1. These are often things that will help with the first as well


---
## 1. Prepare you for the consulting practicum (Stat 551)

* understand how the data was collected

* implications of the collection process for analysis

* organize data for analysis

* determine appropriate methods for analysis that *answer's the client's questions*

* interpret the results

* present and communicate the results

???
* In most courses you get nice clean data. Getting to "nice clean data" is non-trivial
* In most courses things are "iid", negligible missingness
* Usually, the question is formed in statistical langauge, here, you are responsible for "translating"
* Interpretation has to be "translated back"
* Presentation skills --- important everywhere

---
## 2. Some skills you'll need

* Version control

* Reproducible reports

* Writing experience: genre is important

* Presentation skills

* Better coding practice

* Documentation

---

## How will this be achieved?

.emphasis[.large[Most course activities will be organized around a 
series of case studies and reading assignments 
from different subject-areas]]

* interactive class discussions 

* formulation of statistical approaches to solve research 
problems 

* data exploration, model building and statistical 
inference 

* written and oral presentations of results

<br><br>

--

> Be prepared for something different: 
> 1. Expect to participate actively in discussion
> 2. Do not expect "right" answers

---
## Course content

* Statistical topics (some known, some new) using a case studies
    1. Work in groups on activities 
    2. Class discussion
    3. R coding
    4. Some data analysis

* Communication (oral and written)
    1. Guidelines to improve
    2. Individual presentations
    3. Class discussions
    4. Written reports and peer-evaluation

---
## Computing

* All work done in R/Rmarkdown. 

* No you can't use Python. Or Stata or SPSS.

* No you can't use Jupyter Notebooks.

* All materials on Github. 

* You will learn to use Git/Github/RStudio/Rmarkdown.

* Slack for discussion/communication

## Assessments

| Activity | Total: 100 points|
|:-- | --: |
| Group Homework (2 case studies) | 20 points |
| HW Peer-evals | 10 points |
| HW Revisions | 10 points |
| Final project | 15 points |
| Presentation | 15 points |
| In-class work | 15 points |
| Professionalism | 15 points |


--

* First 3 are "case studies", random groups of 3
* Project is another case study
* Presentation is on your own
* In-class work is TBA

---

## Professionalism

Time management
: on-time to class, meets deadlines, etc.

#### Courtesy
: reads instructions, doesn't ask silly questions, respects classmates/teammates

#### Preparedness
: actively participates in class discussions, demonstrates enthusiasm for listening to others

#### Integrity/Honesty
: Produces work of the highest quality that reflects best effort; makes strong effort to improve work; shows positive, proactive behavior

#### Collaboration
: Makes obvious and significant contributions in groupwork and class discussion; genuine effort to work effectively with others; often takes leadership role

## Good-faith effort

---

## Goes for me too

* This class has changed a lot in last 2 years

* I'm not a consultant

* I'm not a biostatistician

* I'm going to do my best

* I hope you learn some useful skills / techniques
